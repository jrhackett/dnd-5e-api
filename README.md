# DnD 5e Spells

This application helps display and organize spells for Dungeons and Dragons 5e. It includes an API to query spells as well as a frontend that has a number of features. This project serves as a place to practice full stack development while also giving friends a way to organize spells in 5e. The server and client are both progressing and I am adding features as I can. The goal is to create a tool that makes it easier to organize resources for players and game masters.

## Roadmap

* Add users and sessions to both the server and UI
* Custom spells in the UI
* More robust filtering and sorting support in UI and API
* More organized spellbook views
* Secure deployment strategy
* Compare spells by some heuristic
